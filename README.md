# bare-kit

Bare for native application development. The kit provides a web worker-like API to start and manage isolated Bare threads, called worklets[^1], that expose an IPC abstraction with bindings for various languages.

[^1]: This term was chosen to avoid ambiguity with worker threads as implemented by <https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-worker>.
