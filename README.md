# bare-kit

Bare for native application development. The kit provides a web worker-like API to start and manage an isolated Bare thread, called a worklet[^1], that exposes an IPC abstraction with bindings for various languages.

[^1]: This term was chosen to avoid ambiguity with worker threads as implemented by <https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-worker>.
